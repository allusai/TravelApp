Key Points:
1) When debugging, rather than try 5 different approaches at once, try just one approach completely
and if it doesn't work for a specific reason then try the next approach. For example, when I was
trying to get the AWS database to work, I kind of made a Plan B, Plan C, and Plan D before I even
tried the simplest version which was Plan A. That made it hard to advance the debugging efforts
for any plan.
2) In Android, each Activity (like MainActivity) has a wider range of tools available like
getSupportFragmentManager or holding onto app-wide data like queryManager and the placesList.
If we need to get those into somewhere like LocationAdapter, it's best to pass those through
with the LocationAdapter constructor. Adapter and Fragment java files have a limited amount of
libraries accessible to them and often you will have to make 'static' methods to help them access
app-wide data but that's hard to get working, that's why passing via the constructor is better.
3) Don't use XML onClick attribute, use the onClickListener, it allows for better compatibility
with ViewHolders and Recycler Lists












Notes While Developing:

Alright, so based on how we want our view page to look, I thought that "multiple view holder"
is the key but it's not! That's when you want a list view but have different types of holders
like one for phone contacts and one for email contacts.

We want *just a ViewHolder*, it by itself can hold different view objects if we try. So the Medium
article was really unnecessary.

Unresolved challenges at this point:
How can I make a ViewHolder that holds two things (a TextView for the restaurant name and an
ImageButton for the alarm picture and that's all)
Where do I implement the alarm's onClick function, which file
How can I add a favorite button for toggling (see short Youtube tutorial)
How can I make a ViewHolder that holds three things
How do I enable list item selection (it's shown on the original Android tutorial)


ViewHolder with two things
--------------------------
restaurantName and alarmButton

 - We defined in one_location.xml what the UI design should look like with restaurant name
    and alarm button
 - Now in our Adapter, we must inflate the XML markup and turn it into code-usable data structures like
    "TextView restaurantName" and "ImageButton alarmButton" which Android can use in the code

ViewHolder container Constructor
 - For that, we define the variables in a "ViewHolder", it's like a bucket in which you can put as
    many individual View objects as you want. Next, we define a constructor which takes in a
    generic View object. In that View object you can use findById to get the two corresponding
    XML ids for each UI element and then set your Java object to that (casted). That generic View
    object seems to be a LinearLayout (top-level container), but I could be wrong.

LocationAdapter Constructor / Dataset Loader
    - Just sets mDataset to whatever is passed in for my Dataset

onCreateViewHolder
    - I added code to inflate one_location.xml


TO Do:
1) Try the if(location == "Paris") return null to see if the spinner really
influences the dataset and adapter > QueryMaker.java should have three different possible outputs, spinner binding already set
2) Figure out where the alarm button went off to, does it show up in one_location.xml > Yes, use component navigator pane!
3) Make those work together, then add the favorite and "Category" as a vertical linear layout

onClick function in one_location.xml has to be implemented in the *Activity* where the XML
element will show up. In this case it is MainActivity.java.
The signature is " public void showTimePickerDialog(View alarm)"
which matched with "public void <function>(View v)"
Note that the parameter is just "View v" and not "ImageButton v"

1) Add the Vertical linear layout, Medium article can help
2) Move the code over to the Home fragment
3) Make the alarm functional, initialize default value in Adapter itself
